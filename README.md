## SETUP REACTJS FROM SCRATCH USING VARIOUS JAVASCRIPT TOOLS
##### This documentation was done as i was learning from https://egghead.io/courses/modern-javascript-tooling-with-react

##### At egghead.io we can learn the difficult parts of the techologies in a very easy and understandle short video from field leading experts. I am very happy with experience and the things i am learning at egghead.io. [Click here](https://egghead.io/?rc=k8fwwp) to signup now

### 1. Create a project and initialise a git repo
Note: I am assuming you have the git and latest nodejs installed.
Open the terminal and create a folder where you want keep the project code
```
 mkdir react-from-scratch
 cd react-from-scratch
 npm init
```
A list of config questions will be asked. Answer all of them and submit.
Now we have the package.json created in our folder. 
Lets initialize the git now.
```
git init
```
this will initialize the git. Now lets commit the package.json file
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
We have commited the file locally but not yet pushed to the remote.
Create a repository in your github repository and it will show the details to push the data from a existing local repository. Copy and paste it in your terminal
It will look something like this

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/sudarshanshenoy/React-from-scracth-setup.git
git push -u origin master
```

### 2. Start with Javascript and Webpack
Create a folder with name src and create index.js file with the following content
```
console.log("Hello World");
```
Now to bundle the javascript file we have to install Webpack
```
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```
Now you can see node_modules folder and inside that the there is .bin folder
Open the .bin and you can see executable file for webpack
Let run and see what happens.
```
node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
When you run this a bundle javascript file is generated in the dist folder
Lets run the bundle file 'main.js' file
```
node dist/main.js
```
This will output 'Hello World'

Rather than running 'node_modules/.bin/webpack' every time we can add it to the scripts in package.json
```
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
 }
```
Now we can run the following command to build the files
```
npm run build
```
Now if we run 'git status' command we can find that there is node_modules, dist and some other files as well.
We dont want to add node_modules and dist to github. 
Create a file called gitignore with the following content to ignore these folders
```
dist/
node_modules/
```
### 3. Add webpack.config.js file
First let add a new js file person.js with following content
```
const person = 'Sudarshan Shenoy'

export default person;
```
and import the file in index.js
```
import person from './person';

console.log(`Hello ${person}`);
```
Create webpack.config.js with following content
the entry attribute should have the path to main path from where the webpack has bundle
Under output we have path attribute which should contain absolute path to the output folder and so we use the path library from node
```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'app.bundle.js'
  }
}
```
after this run
```
npm run build
node dist/app.bundle.js
```
